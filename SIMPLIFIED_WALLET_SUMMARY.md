# Simplified Wallet Feature Summary

## What Changed

âœ… **Removed status/approval system** - No more pending/approved/rejected states
âœ… **Removed admin intervention** - No admin panel or approval process needed
âœ… **Instant coin addition** - Coins are added immediately when teachers submit requests
âœ… **Simplified database** - Removed status, notes fields from transactions table
âœ… **Cleaner code** - Removed all admin-related controllers, views, and routes

## How It Works Now

1. **Teacher goes to wallet** (`/wallet`) - sees current balance and transaction history
2. **Teacher clicks "Add Funds"** (`/wallet/add-funds`) - fills form with:
   - Payment method (bKash, Rocket, Nagad, Banking)
   - Account number
   - Amount (1-10,000 coins)
3. **Submit form** - Coins are **immediately added** to teacher's account
4. **Transaction recorded** - Entry created in transactions table for reference
5. **Teacher responsibility** - Teacher must complete actual payment using their method

## Database Structure

**transactions table:**
```sql
- transaction_id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key to users)
- account_number (Payment account - NULL for non-wallet transactions)
- amount (Coin amount)
- type (bkash, rocket, banking, nagad)
- description (Transaction description)
- transaction_date (Date)
- created_at, updated_at (Timestamps)
```
